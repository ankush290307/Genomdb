### Additional Notes:

- **Images:**
  - Ensure that all image URLs are correct. If images like `GenomDB.png`, `genomdb-screenshot.png`, and `genomdb-footer.png` are hosted in the repository, reference them with relative paths, e.g., `![GenomDB Logo](images/GenomDB.png)` assuming they are in an `images` folder.
  - For external images, ensure the URLs are accessible.

- **Links:**

  - Ensure that the links to documentation (User Guide, ViroBLAST Documentation, etc.) are correctly pointing to your actual documentation resources.

- **Contributing Guidelines:**
  - If you have separate CONTRIBUTING.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md files, reference them correctly in the links.

- **License:**
  - Ensure that the LICENSE file is present in your repository and properly formatted.

- **Visual Enhancements:**
  - Adding badges (e.g., build status, license, GitHub stars) at the top can enhance the README's appearance and provide quick information.
